## Bio
I am currently a 3rd year PhD Candidate in Statistics at Rice University. My advisor is Dr. Marina Vannucci. 

For my career goals, I am interested in a research-oriented position in the healthcare industry. I hope to develop predictive models that take advantage of the abundance of health data to make relevant inferences and aid in clinical decision-making. 

## Research Interests
My broad research interests are in Bayesian modeling and inference, biomedical and healthcare informatics, predictive modeling and analytics, variable selection, machine learning, and data science.
